# Decentralized Biometric Proof-of-Humanity (PoH) System

## Introduction
This project introduces a decentralized biometric Proof-of-Humanity (PoH) system designed for privacy-preserving, sybil-resistant identity verification. Leveraging biometric data processed locally on smartphones and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), this system generates Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) suitable for Web3 ecosystems such as decentralized finance (DeFi), DAOs, and digital democracy.

## Key Features
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Local biometric data processing ensures no raw data is transmitted or stored.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verifies identity uniqueness without exposing personal data.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle billions of users with decentralized storage and processing.
- **Digital Democracy**: Enables secure and anonymous participation in electronic voting systems.
- **Interoperability**: W3C-compliant DIDs for seamless integration into Web3 platforms.

## Applications
- **Digital Democracy**: Resolves anonymous voting challenges by associating DIDs with countries or organizations.
- **DeFi and DAOs**: Prevent sybil attacks and ensure fair voting and participation.
- **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Verifies unique recipients for equitable resource distribution.
